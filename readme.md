# these are simple code snippets to encode and decode back files.
1. the Encrypt-Decrypt.js is used for text/strings.
2. the encoder.html encodes any file to base64 and output is logged, can be used for pre-hashing.
3. the decoder.js converts the base64 from the encoder.js to the actual files they were before encoding.
